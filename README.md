# GitHub Action: Setup Buildless

This repository provides a [GitHub Action][0] to setup [Buildless][1] within your workflows. Supported features:

- **Buildless CLI:** Install and authorize the Buildless CLI
- **Buildless Agent:** Install and run the near-caching Buildless Agent
- **GHA-compatible:** Drop-in replacement for `actions/cache` (it's just faster, and linked to your Buildless account)

## Usage

**Install the latest Buildless CLI, add it to the `PATH`, and run the agent**
```yaml
  - name: "Setup: Buildless"
    uses: buildless/setup@v1
```

**Install the latest Buildless CLI, add it to the `PATH`, without the agent:**
```yaml
  - name: "Setup: Buildless"
    uses: buildless/setup@v1
    with:
      agent: false  # you really should use the agent tho
```

## Authorization

The CLI and Agent will both **automatically use `BUILDLESS_APIKEY`**, if present, to authorize cache traffic and cloud backhaul.
If no authorization material is present, only local caching is enabled.

Sign up for a [Buildless Cloud][1] account to obtain an API key. It's free to start.

## What is Buildless?

[Buildless][0] is a build caching system which works with most build tools. If you have a build tool that supports remote caching, Buildless can
probably plug right in, and it makes development fast and fun.

Supported language ecosystems and toolchains include:

- **Gradle, Maven, JVM** (Kotlin, Java, Groovy, Scala, et al)
- **Bazel** (supports gRPC build cache APIs)
- **C, C++, Swift, Rust, etc** (C-like toolchains, via tools like `sccache`)
- **JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, etc** (with tools like `turborepo`)
